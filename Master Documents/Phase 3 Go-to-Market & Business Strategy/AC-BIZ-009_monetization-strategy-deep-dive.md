## 1. Monetization Principles
1. **Core Free:** browsing, claiming, messaging, and yearbook access remain free to maximize adoption.
2. **Value-Add Premium:** alumni pay when they create, organize, or promote (events, businesses, jobs).
3. **School Partnerships:** schools/universities subsidize premium tools for verified alumni groups.
4. **Transparent & Fair:** no paywalls on reconnecting; fees tied to added utility.
