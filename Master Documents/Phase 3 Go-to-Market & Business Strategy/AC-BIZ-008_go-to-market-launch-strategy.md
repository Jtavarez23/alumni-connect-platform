# Alumni Connect — Go-To-Market Launch Plan (Step 8)

**Owner:** Jose Tavarez  
**Author:** Product/Strategy  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Goal:** Outline launch strategy, onboarding, viral loops, moderator recruitment, and early monetization pilots to make Alumni Connect erupt at launch.

---

## 1. Launch Objectives
- **North Star:** verified alumni claiming yearbook photos.
- **90-Day Goals:**
  - 10,000 users signed up.
  - 1,000 yearbooks uploaded.
  - 5,000 claims approved.
  - 100 events created (school reunions, alumni groups).

---

## 2. Target Market Entry
- **Beachhead:** Florida high schools (dense alumni base, strong community ties).  
- **Reason:** easier to seed yearbooks, geographic network effects, and leverage local events.
- **Expansion:** other Southeast states → national rollout.

---

## 3. Onboarding Flow
1. **Sign Up:** email/social login.
2. **Add School:** pick from clean directory, select grad year.
3. **Claim Prompt:** suggest faces/names from uploaded yearbooks.
4. **Network Suggestions:** mutual classmates, events near you.
5. **First Action CTAs:** claim a photo, upload a yearbook, invite classmates.

**Empty State CTAs:**
- Feed empty → “Claim your yearbook photo to unlock your network.”
- Yearbooks empty → “Upload your class yearbook to help classmates reconnect.”

---

## 4. Viral Loops
- **Claim → Share:** after claim approval, generate branded share image (“Jose claimed his 2009 Miami High photo — Join to claim yours”).
- **Invite Link:** pre-filled with school + grad year for frictionless onboarding.
- **Weekly Digest:** highlight new classmates joined; nudge to return.
- **Event RSVPs:** public alumni reunions require RSVP via Alumni Connect.

---

## 5. Moderator Recruitment
- **Tiered Roles:** school admins, moderators, verified alumni.
- **Early Incentive:** badge + free premium event tools.
- **Recruitment Channels:**
  - Reach out to class presidents, reunion organizers, PTA leaders.
  - Offer early access perks (profile highlighting, premium listing for businesses).
