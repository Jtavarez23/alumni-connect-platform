-- Fix 406 (Not Acceptable) errors for social_proof_metrics table
-- The issue is that the existing RLS policies are too restrictive and blocking the query
-- This script will create more permissive policies to allow authenticated users to read the data

-- First, let's check what policies currently exist
SELECT 
  'Current policies on social_proof_metrics:' as info,
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  policyname, 
  permissive, 
  roles, 
  cmd, 
  qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'social_proof_metrics';

-- Drop the existing restrictive policies that are causing the 406 error
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view social proof metrics for their schools" ON public.social_proof_metrics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own social proof metrics" ON public.social_proof_metrics;

-- Create simple, permissive policies that allow authenticated users to access the data
-- This will resolve the 406 (Not Acceptable) error

-- Allow all authenticated users to read social_proof_metrics
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read social_proof_metrics"
ON public.social_proof_metrics FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Allow users to insert/update their own metrics
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to manage their own social_proof_metrics"
ON public.social_proof_metrics FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Allow service role full access for admin operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role full access to social_proof_metrics"
ON public.social_proof_metrics FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true);

-- Verify RLS is still enabled (should be true)
SELECT
