## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Table does not exist" Errors
**Cause**: Database migrations not run
**Fix**: 
1. Follow `MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Run all 3 migration files in Supabase Dashboard
3. Verify with `node scripts/test-v2-features.js`

### Issue 2: Import/Component Errors
**Common Fixes**:
```bash
# If you see import errors, check these files exist:
src/components/search/SearchQuotaWidget.tsx
src/components/messaging/MessagingRestrictions.tsx  
src/components/social/SocialMediaIntegration.tsx
src/components/suggestions/ClassmateSuggestionEngine.tsx
src/components/analytics/ProfileAnalyticsDashboard.tsx
```

### Issue 3: Supabase Connection Issues
**Fix**: Update supabase imports in components:
```typescript
// Change from:
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';
// To:
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';
```

### Issue 4: Hook Not Found Errors
**Fix**: Ensure updated `useSubscription` hook is used:
```typescript
// Should include new methods:
const { 
  canSearch, 
  useSearch, 
  canSendMessage,
  trackProfileView,
  canSuggestClassmate 
} = useSubscription();
```

   - Premium users should get enhanced features
   - Discovery should work through social connections

4. **Subscription System Integration**
   - All features should respect subscription tiers
   - Upgrade prompts should appear consistently
   - Premium features should be properly gated
