# Directory Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes what files and directories were moved to the `_TO_REVIEW` folder for your review.

## Files Moved and Organized

### üóÇÔ∏è Migration Scripts (`/migration_scripts/`)
- All SQL migration files (apply_*.sql, fix_*.sql, create_*.sql, etc.)
- JavaScript migration and setup scripts (*.js, *.mjs, *.cjs)
- Database schema and RLS policy files
- Legacy build and deployment scripts

**Purpose**: These are one-time setup files that were used during initial development and database setup. They're likely no longer needed for production.

### üìö Old Documentation (`/old_documentation/`)
- Legacy audit reports and requirements documents
- Old testing guides and migration instructions
- Deprecated development documentation
- Security audit reports from earlier phases

**Purpose**: These documents were useful during development phases but are now superseded by current documentation.

### üß™ Temporary Files (`/temp_files/`)
- Test files and debugging scripts
- Temporary SQL queries and fixes
- Development setup files (like deepseek setup)
- Backup configuration files

**Purpose**: These were temporary files used during development and debugging.

## Files Kept in Root Directory

### ‚úÖ Essential Files Remaining:
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` - Project dependencies
- `vite.config.ts` / `tsconfig.json` - Build configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `components.json` - UI component configuration
- `index.html` - Entry point
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- Current documentation files (MASTER_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Essential Directories:
- `src/` - Source code
- `public/` - Static assets
- `supabase/` - Database configuration
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- `dist/` - Build output
- `.git/` - Version control

## Review Instructions

1. **Safe to Delete**: Most files in migration_scripts and temp_files
2. **Archive**: Old documentation files can be archived
3. **Check Before Deleting**:
   - Any files you specifically remember needing
   - Configuration files that might be referenced elsewhere

## Recommended Action

After reviewing, you can safely delete the `_TO_REVIEW` folder contents as they represent:
- Legacy development artifacts
- One-time setup scripts that have already been executed
- Superseded documentation
- Temporary development files

The remaining root directory now contains only essential files needed for the application to function.
