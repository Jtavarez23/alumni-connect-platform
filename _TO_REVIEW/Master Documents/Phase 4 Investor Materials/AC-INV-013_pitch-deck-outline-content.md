## 2. Problem
- Alumni lose touch after graduation; Facebook/LinkedIn don’t capture school-first networks.
- Reunion planning is fragmented, yearbooks are inaccessible.
- Alumni businesses and jobs lack a verified alumni network.

**Key stat:** 130M+ US alumni, billions globally.

---

## 3. Solution
- **Yearbook-first social graph**: claim your photo → verified alumni → connect.
- **Platform:** yearbooks, events, alumni directory, business listings, jobs, mentorship.
- **Differentiation:** nostalgia + verification → trust + engagement.

---

## 4. Product Demo (Screens)
- Upload wizard.
- Yearbook reader with claim flow.
- Dual feeds (Network, For You).
- Event creation + ticketing.
- Business directory cards.
- Messaging + notifications.

- **TAM (Total Addressable):** $10B+ (alumni + events + business listings + jobs).
- **SAM (Serviceable Available):** $2B (US alumni networking + reunions).
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable):** $500M (initial US high schools + colleges).

## 8. Go-To-Market Strategy
- Beachhead: Florida high schools.
- Viral loop: claim photo → invite classmates.
- Ambassador program: class leaders, reunion organizers.
- PR: Throwback Thursday campaigns, reunion press.

---

## 9. Competitive Landscape
- **Facebook/LinkedIn:** broad, not alumni-specific.
- **Classmates.com:** outdated, no viral loop.
- **Alumni Connect:** yearbook-first, modern, mobile-first.

Visual: 2x2 matrix → Nostalgia vs Modern + Verified vs Unverified.
