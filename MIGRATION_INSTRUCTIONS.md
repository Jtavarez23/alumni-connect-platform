# ðŸš€ Reconnect Hive V2 Database Migration Guide

Since we can't run automated migrations, here's how to manually apply the V2 schema updates through Supabase Dashboard:

## Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `dyhloaxsdcfgfyfhrdfc`
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New query"**

## Step 2: Run Migration Scripts (In Order)

### Migration 1: Core V2 Schema
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250903160000_multi_school_v2_architecture.sql` into the SQL editor and click **"Run"**.

This will create:
- âœ… `user_education` table for multi-school support
- âœ… Updated `profiles` table with subscription tiers
- âœ… `profile_views` for premium analytics
- âœ… `search_quotas` for daily limits
- âœ… `messaging_permissions` for network restrictions
- âœ… All other V2 tables and RLS policies

### Migration 2: Data Migration
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250903161000_migrate_existing_data.sql` and click **"Run"**.

This will:
- âœ… Backup existing data
- âœ… Migrate current school relationships to `user_education`
- âœ… Set up subscription tiers
- âœ… Initialize search quotas
- âœ… Create messaging permissions for existing friendships

### Migration 3: RPC Functions  
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250903162000_add_rpc_functions.sql` and click **"Run"**.

This adds:
- âœ… Search quota management functions
- âœ… Profile analytics functions
- âœ… Activity feed functions
- âœ… Messaging permission checks

## Step 3: Verify Migration Success

Run this verification query in SQL editor:

```sql
-- Check if all tables exist and have data
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  n_tup_ins as "rows_inserted",
  n_tup_upd as "rows_updated"
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE tablename IN (
  'user_education',
  'profile_views', 
  'search_quotas',
  'messaging_permissions',
  'social_connections',
  'classmate_suggestions',
  'activity_feed',
  'group_chats'
)
ORDER BY tablename;
```

## Step 4: Test New Features

Run this query to check if the data migration worked:

```sql
-- Verify migration success
SELECT * FROM verify_migration_v2();
```

If all checks show `success = true`, run the cleanup:

```sql
-- Clean up after successful migration
SELECT cleanup_migration_v2();
```

## Step 5: Update RLS Policies (If Needed)

If you encounter permission issues, you may need to update RLS policies. The migrations should handle this automatically, but if needed, you can run:

```sql
-- Grant permissions to authenticated users
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
```

## Expected Results After Migration:

âœ… **Free Tier Users:**
- Can add 1 school
- 3 searches per day  
- Message only network connections
- Year-limited networking

âœ… **Premium Users:**
- Unlimited schools
- Unlimited searches
- Message anyone
- All-years networking
- Profile analytics

âœ… **Data Integrity:**
- All existing users migrated
- School relationships preserved
- Friendships maintained
- No data loss

## Troubleshooting:

### "Permission denied" errors:
- Make sure you're logged in as the project owner
- Check that RLS policies are properly set

### "Table already exists" errors:
- This is normal for some tables - the migration will continue

### "Function does not exist" errors:
- Make sure Migration 3 (RPC functions) completed successfully

## Next Steps After Migration:

Once migration is complete, you can proceed with:
1. âœ… Testing the new subscription features
2. âœ… Integrating search quota widgets  
3. âœ… Adding messaging restrictions
4. âœ… Building premium features
